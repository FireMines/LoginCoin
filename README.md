I would recommend running this in Remix.ethereum.org

This is due to just having to import it and then you can compile and run it with ease. This will fix imports and downloads for you.
Just go to the Solidity compiler and after its been compiled you open the Deploy and Run transactions tab.

Make sure to have Truffle and Ganache downloaded to set up a test network.
